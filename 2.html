<h2>Bread</h2>Bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour and water, usually by baking.
Throughout recorded history, it has been a prominent food in large parts of the world.
It is one of the oldest man-made foods, having been of significant importance since the dawn of agriculture, 
and plays an essential role in both religious rituals and secular culture.<br>
Bread may be leavened by naturally occurring microbes, chemicals, industrially produced yeast, or high-pressure aeration. 
In many countries, commercial bread often contains additives to improve flavor, texture, color, shelf life, nutrition, and ease of production.<br>
